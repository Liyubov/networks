# Random walk analysis

Random walk is a key concept for many fields of natural science. 
To learn more about it go to

# Code for random walks analysis

First I do simulations (jupiter notebook) for the standard random walks analysis. 
Then I do simulations for the continuous limits of continuous time random walks in 2D, but this can be extended to 3D.

This project is based on the model described in our recent articles
